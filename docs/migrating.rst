Migrating
=========

Welcome to the area4 migration guide.

1.x -> 2.x
----------

To migrate from v1, you will need to change all divider calls from:

.. code-block:: python

    area4.dividerX
    # or
    area4.divX()

Where :code:`X` is the divider number, to:

.. code-block:: python

    area4.divider(X)

2.x -> 3.x
----------

This version is WIP.
